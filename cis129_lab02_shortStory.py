print('There once was a boy living in a desolate town with a small population.')
print('His favorite person was his uncle who showed him tons of cool things.')
print('His father did not like this uncle, as he had a history of delinquency.')
print('The boy and uncle went out to the beach to teach the boy how to swim.')
print('The father did not like this news and ran to get the boy back.')
print('The father catches up to the boy and uncle and begin to argue.')
print('As they argue, the boy notices a bear cub, he gets near him and is immediately clawed at.')
print('The uncle and father take notice and pull the boy back, as they make loud sounds to scare the bear cub away')
print('The boy and uncle have a laugh as they make sure the boy is okay.')
print('As they turn back to return home, a giant bear blasts through the bushes angry as can be.')
print('The boy, uncle, and father all scream and zoom back to town.')
print('All three return to their town.')
